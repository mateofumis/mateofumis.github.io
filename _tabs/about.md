## Hi everyone, I'm Mateo! üëãüëã

I am Pentester and Ethical Hacker, Cybersecurity Enthusiast and Bug Bounty Hunter. I started my career in Cybersecurity around October 2022 and then I'm currently studying all about Pentesting and Cybersecurity. I love to solve machines in Hack The Box and the Labs of Port Swigger's Web Security Academy. Also I'm focused in the Bug Bounty Hunting on HackerOne.

### üíª Currently on 2024 I spend my time as Bug Bounty Hunter on **HackerOne, Intigriti and Bugcrowd**.

Through the manipulation of the APIs used by Web Applications, I learned techniques such as Fuzzing and techniques of changes in the various methods of Requests (such as GET, POST, HEAD, OPTIONS, PUT, PATCH, DELETE, etc ...) by which as Pentester, in a web audit, it is possible to breach and *access privileged functions* (Broken Function Level Authorization) or *sensitive information* (Sensitive Data Exposure). I also learned how to perform token attacks, such as JWTs attacks (JSON Web Tokens).

#### üìöüíª Currently I like to program mainly in Bash Scripting and Python which helps me when analyzing code for vulnerabilities and creating some simple scripts when pentesting.

#### However I have in mind to continue learning programming, specifically the Golang language to then create scripts that automate the task of Web Pentesting and contribute to the community of Hackers and Pentesters on Github.
